          <p>I have been studying Web Development & Design since 2018. I have a working understanding of "The Big Three" - HTML, CSS, and Javascript. At present I am taking a 16-credit college certificate program at the County College of Morris (CCM) to sharpen my skills in this challenging and fascinating field.</p>

            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <p>I began learning web development in July 2018. Prior to that I had dabbled in compterish things, earning certificates in Word and Excel. Going back even further, I took a few courses in COBOL, and I remember barely a keystroke today. At the time, I sensed computers just weren't for me - that was in spring of 1993, and the Internet was yet to explode, which it did indeed with the launch of Yahoo in 1994. In the meantime, I pursued other objectives, and now I have come full circle back to tech.</p>

            <h2>Coursework</h2>
            <p>In process: Web Development Certificate at CCM. This program is designed to build competence with all relevant and necessary tools, beginning with advanced HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other scripting languages. Skills are honed to create and maintain websites that are responsive and dynamic. The use of development tools in building dynamic Web sites is mastered.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>See my projects below. Along the way, I have encountered SASS/BEM, GitHub, Node.js, image manipulation, NPM Webpack, ReactJS, MongoDB, C#, PHP, web hosting, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, HEX/RGB, and more. My experience has been enlightening and enjoyable, and sometimes exasperating - but in the best way possible, because the greatest learning comes through solving problems. All is a work in progress!</p>

            <h2>More...</h2>
            <p>I have enjoyed this process, having built a site for a fictitious web agency, and an equally-whimsical tech news site called InfoQuarter. I also regularly update this portfolio page. There is so much to learn, but I am amazed at what I can do after just three short years of (mostly) self-education!</p>

          <h2>Learning Every Day</h2>
          <p>I live in northwestern NJ. My first actual solicited project was, naturally enough, for family. The Irish side of the family tree had a stack of family history items scattered about, amd much of it kept getting lost and then reappearing. I was asked to compile and preserve this material, and a website seemed to be the perfect vehicle for this request.</p>

          <p>My next experience with design and development came via a request from a friend to help him with a book project. He has since built his own site with Wix, but the experience for me was invaluable. We shared ideas, and I built a prototype site for him. I have kept this site as part of my portfolio and update it regularly with new ideas and formats. Incidentally, his book, called "MAC'S Robot," is a wonderful tale aimed at kids from ages three to five - nevertheless, kids from ages 30 through 50 will enjoy it as well!</p>
